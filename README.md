# Neural style transfer with TensorFlow

This is a set of instructions, surrounding and complementary to those at:

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer

.

The official docker image contains only the core tools. To run
the Neural Style Transfer example, it is necesssary to build on top
of the official image:

```
# docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:2.1.1
...
# docker build -t tensorflow-2.1.1-styles .
...
```

Then you have:

```
# docker images
